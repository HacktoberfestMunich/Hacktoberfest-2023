# Hacktoberfest-2023

This repository is the playground for the Hacktoberfest Munich event 2023.

We are hosting an local pixelflut server at our office and the participats get several challenges to solve.
The solutions of every team will be in the different team folders.
CI will build the solutions and push them as docker images to the ghcr registry.
